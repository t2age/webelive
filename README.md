# About "WebeLive" word
![WebeLive]()  
  
When I first started playing with Web Real Time stuff I was using the term "Web Live" to refer to the things that uses the notion of a web in "live" fashion (meaning "real time")...  
  
But, slowly I realized that there is much more than just making real time communication on the Internet, there are lots and lots of tools that we can use to explore the notion of "live" and Internet together...  
  
My perception has changed and I was still refering to it as "Web Live", then I decide to change the term (word) that I was using, so to tell me (and others) that it is more than just a real time web, but I did not want something to much removed from the "web live" aspect... so I decide to create a new term, "WebeLive" and attach the following meaning to it...  
  
a) Web Live Tools  
b) Web (which is) Alive  
c) Web (in which we) Believe  
  
**a) Web Live tools -**  
Tools to help in real time communication on the web...  
Human to human text, voice, video in real-time can be very helpfull in many situations, and there are many tools that allow us to explore more the "live" aspect of the Internet...  
Also, human to human communication is just one part of the Web, today there are more "stuff" connected than there are humans, so, live connections between stuff should also be considered within this category of use...  
  
  
**b) Web which is "Alive" -**  
Web-tools that can have more broader impact on human live (beyond real time communication)...  
Perhaps, people are just using something around 10% of the power of the Web, and there are lots of easy and simple ways to explore the other, probably, 90%...  
  
Real Time communication on the Web is an interesting topic, but it is not the only way to have a truly "live" mechanism, there are lots of data/information that, if it is updated only every minutes, or, only every hour, can also help people to explore more the potential of the Web... in this sense, "live" does not mean instantaneos, instead, it will mean updated to the appropriated or desired time period...  
  
Perhaps, because the Web was born with the Desktop PC, it is still being perceived within the "optics" of the Desktop PC, which, by now is quite obsolete, and yet, still the predominant mindset...  
  
Since 2007, with the creation of the smartphone (and later the tablet), the Web has made huge progress, specially because the smartphone gives mobility to the web, and also sensors like cameras, GPS, accelerometers, etc... and so, the smartphone has helped the Web to be moree "alive" than before, in a huge step forward...  
  
STILL, in my opinion, another BIG STEP FORWARD is unleashed when we start to explore the full potential of the SBC (single board computer) in relation to a "live" (or alive) Web...  
  
  
**c) Web that we can Believe -**  
Tools to help explore the Person-to-Person aspect of the Internet, for example when two friends are connected by Person-to-Person link, a higher level of trust can be achieved from the point of view of privacy and safety, thus, having a "Web" that we can TRUST, that we can BELIEVE IN...  
  
One of the reasons we are only using a tiny fraction of the Web power is related to safety and privacy concerns, so that, because we DO NOT TRUST, then, we DON'T USE... it is a self-reinforced meachanism, and because we are not making a GOOD USE of it, we tend to not TRUST IT... it is strange to us...  
  
The KEY POINT here is that, any bit of improvement on safety and privacy should unleash lot of the Web true potential...  
  
Person to Person connections together with low cost Single Board Computers (SBCs), is such powerful combination to help safety and privacy, and the tools and knowledge to explore it are, ALREADY, in the hands of the people, such as basic knowledge of JavaScript coding...  
  
-----
  
There are many tools within this category of "WebeLive", sometimes they can be used solo/standalone, sometimes we need to combine them to achieve greater benefits... what I believe is important is to create a name to describe this category/possibility, so that, every time we discover a new tool that can be inside this subject, then, we just "add" it to the pool of "WebeLive" tools... in time, we will find interesting combinations...  
  
I am trying to give some examples in this subject under the name "WL (WebeLive)"... just few in number but easy enough for large number of people to try, learn, adapt, get inspiration and create something around the same subject... hope so...
